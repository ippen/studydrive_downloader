## Update 06.03.2024

Regrettably, due to legal constraints, it has become necessary to render this website non-functional. This compromise was reached to prevent Studydrive from pursuing legal actions. Although this marks the end of the website's functionality, I am grateful for the kind exchange I had with them on LinkedIn. I extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who supported this website and sent encouraging messages in the past. Your support has been deeply appreciated.
